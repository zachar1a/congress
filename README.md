# Congress

This is a simple website using django on the backend as well as utilizing django-rest.
I am using this in conjunction with React.js to load the frontend.

The backend serializes the responses from ProPublica because they remove their data
after each congress and I would like to keep a documented history of what has happened
in each congress.

This is viewable at state-of-congress.herokuapp.com
