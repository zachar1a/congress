# Congress
This is a simple website using django and the ProPublica api to retrieve information on bills and which congress men/women have voted.


# Change Of Course
I am now going to save all of the data into a db and in then turn it into an api that I will be able to call from a react front end.

There is literally no reason for me to over engineer something as simple as this other than I want to show off that I can work with any framework and I have no idea what to build to show that off other than this.

Added in the vote results and now i just need to add in some routes so votes and bills are not on the same page

Developing the cards for bills and votes

# Nov. 1, 2020
Added in some routing for the pages, probably am going to want to create a landing page for this, just to show off the latest bills and votes or something

Created the latest bill and vote api endpoint and added them into the home component

# Jan 1, 2021
Going to try and create downloadable files with the information with what is given to us from the api. This is going to be congressional
vote data as well as bill data.
